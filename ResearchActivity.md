#Research Activity Assignment

##What is a SRE (Site Reliability Engineer)
-They are responsible for how code is deployed, configured, and monitored.
-They split their time between operation tasks and project Work
-They are also responsible for automating a solution for consistent problems

##How Are SRE and DevOps different?
-SRE is considered an implementation of DevOps
-They both try to bridge the gap between development and operations teams
-SRE differs because it is more oriented towards a development team who also have an operations background
-DevOps focuses on moving through development pipline efficiently and SRE focuses on balance with new features

##Tools Used by DevOps
-Version Control Tools such as Github (most popular ) or another type of SVC to enhance collaborative coding
-Container Management tools such as Docker and Kubernetes to create and scale containers
-Application Performance Monitoring tools such as prometheus and Dynatrace to indicate any possible weak areas
-Deployment & Server Monitoring tools such as Azure and Splunk to get the application running
-Configuration Management tools such as Chef to make changes and deployments faster
-CI / Deployment Automation tools such as Jenkins to help move software between testing and deployment
-Test Automation tools to test soft with little human interaction
-Artifact Management tools
-Codeless Test Automation Tools
